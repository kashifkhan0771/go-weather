# Contribution guidelines

Fork the go-weather repo and open a PR back from your fork into our default branch.
If possible try to keep PRs scoped to one feature, and add tests for new features. Fork-based contribution model described by [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project).


Let's make this weather client better together!
